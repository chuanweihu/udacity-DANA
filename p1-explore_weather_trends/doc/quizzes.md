## Q1: What tools did you use for each step?

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

## Q2: How did you calculate the moving average?

Use Pandas dataframe. rolling() function, which provides the feature of rolling window calculations.

**For example**:

* calculate 10 simple moving average
`df['SMA_10_gz'] = df.iloc[:, 1].rolling(window=10).mean().round(2)`

## Q3: What were your key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?

I'll take smooth and clearly trend lines for the first consideration.

## Q4: What are observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends?

**Similarities**

* Guangzhou and global average temperature are both observed to be generally increasing trend in the same upwards pattern over the last few hundred years.
* Guangzhou and global average temperature have similar local maximum or minimum in the same year.
* Both Guangzhou and global have a generally consistent increasing trend over the last few hundred years.

**Differences**

* Guangzhou is hotter on average compared to the global average, and the mean annual temperature over Guangzhou was 21.61 degree Celsius(째C) higher than 13.09 degree Celsius(째C)degree Celsius compared with the global.
* The range average temperature of Guangzhou is between 20 to 23 degree Celsius(째C) while the global average is between 7 to 10 degree Celsius(째C).
* The difference between Guangzhou and Global average is decresing since last 50 years (1963-2013), which means the increase of average temperature in global has generally been faster than Guangzhou.
* Guangzhou average temperature has decreased over recent five years, while the global average temperature show a rising sharply trend.
