    "This idea that providing an interval and not just a single estimate will help us gain confidence in our ability to capture a population parameter is at the **core of confidence intervals**.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the wider our interval, the more confident we can be that we capture our parameter of interest.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We can use **bootstrapping** and **sampling distributions** to build **confidence intervals** for our parameters of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "By finding the statistic that best estimates our parameter(s) of interest (say the **sample mean** to estimate the **population mean** or the **difference in sample means** to estimate **the difference in population means)**, we can easily build confidence intervals for the parameter of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want a **95 percent confidence interval**, we could cut off two and a half percent from here and another two and a half percent from up here. These values would then give the range where we believe the parameter would be, with 95 percent confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If alternatively, we wanted a **99 percent confidence interval**, we would cut off a half a percent from each side, and these values would then give the range where we believe the parameter to be with 99 percent confidence.\n",

    "#### 03. ScreenCast: Sampling Distributions and Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video, you saw an example of how to **build a confidence interval** using the **sampling distribution of the statistic** that best estimates your parameter of interest. In this case, we used a **sample mean height** to estimate the **population mean height**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can interpret your confidence interval as **We are 95% confident**, **the population mean falls between the bounds that you find**. Notice that the percent and the parameter can both change depending on what you are building your confidence interval for, and what percentage you cutoff in each tail."
