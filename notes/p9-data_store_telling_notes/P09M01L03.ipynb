    "Here are the areas this lesson will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "**I. Connecting to Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will get started with importing data into Tableau. Tableau public has fewer options, but paid versions of Tableau are quite extensive connecting directly to databases and cloud based data storage systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**II. Combining Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will learn how to connect data from multiple sources for use in your visuals. If you are comfortable with SQL joins, this section should be second nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**III. Worksheets**\n",
    "\n",
    "The visuals you create will be stored in worksheets. This is the template we will be working in for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IV. Aggregations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau performs aggregations of our data by default. In this section, you will learn more about how to work with different aggregations, as well as how to break your aggregations into a more granular level of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**V. Hierarchies**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchies allow you to 'drill' into your data and questions at different levels. One of the easiest ways to think of hierarchies is in relation to time. You could look at your data at a year, month, day, hour, or another level. Moving across these levels is considered working with hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also perform hierarchical calculations in other ways. Imagine you have different companies, with different departments, and teams within those departments. This creates a hierarchy that you might want to analyze at different levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VI. Marks & Filters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering is one of the most powerful techniques in creating dashboards. This relates to the marks portion of a dashboard, which controls the colors, shapes and other attributes of our data. You can think of this like a WHERE statement in SQL used to filter your data to only the parts you are interested in for a specific question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VII. Show Me**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Show Me portion of Tableau controls what your ending visual looks like. There are a lot of options here. In most cases, Tableau will guess what visual you want to create, but sometimes you might have your own ideas for implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VIII. Small Multiples & Dual Axis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Small multiples & dual charts are a way to visualize data that needs to share an axis for comparison purposes. [This](http://www.evolytics.com/blog/tableau-201-how-to-make-small-multiples/) and [this](http://kb.tableau.com/articles/HowTo/dual-axis-bar-chart-multiple-measures) are great articles for explaining how these two parts of Tableau work and why you might use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IX. Groups & Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "Groups and sets are two ways to categorize our data within a visualization. The difference between these two can be confusing, but we will see when and why you would use each.\n",
    "\n",
    "**X. Calculated Fields**\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you might add these fields to your dataset before adding your data to Tableau, but sometimes you want to add them to a visualization on the fly. Many of these calculated fields are things you have probably done in a spreadsheet application like finding a total or a cost per item.\n",
    "\n",
    "**XI. Table Calculations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Table calculations are often used to perform comparisons of our data over time or between groups. A great article on table calculations is available [here](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2017/2/top-10-tableau-table-calculations-65417).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Thoughts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, don't worry if this seems daunting right now. Use this as a resource for what to Google if you get stuck (as the headings are the names Tableau uses - for example `Tableau Table Calculations` will provide more information on the final part we will discuss) and also as a guide for what is to come!"

For example, you might want to include the information from the People sheet with the Orders sheet so you can analyze the performance of each salesperson.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Union**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you **drag People below Orders**, you get a **union**. Unions stack the data on top of each other, the second sheet ends up being **appended to** the end of the first sheet. This works great if you have **multiple sheets with columns in common as the columns will match up**. However if the **columns are different**, then you'll get **a lot of \"nulls\"** because columns are created for both sheets, but the first sheet doesn't have data for the second sheet's columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Joins**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you drag the **second sheet or table** to the **top panel** but **not on top of the first sheet**, you'll get a **join**.

In our case, both Orders and People have a column Region that we can use for the common values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau does an \"**inner join**\" by default. This combines the data wherever there is a common value. So when Region in Orders is \"East\", it takes the data from People where Region is \"East\". Above you can see the Person column from People has been added to the data from Orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can **click on the join symbol** to change the **type of join** being performed. In this case you can also select the \"**left inner join**.\" The **normal inner join** combines only data that is **common**, but the **left inner join** returns all the data in the original sheet setting rows not common to null.\n",

You should follow along with me so you can get some experience creating groups and sets.\n",

You can look more into this by grouping together one of the clusters and doing more visualizations. To select the data points with low average quantity, **hold down the mouse and drag a box around the left cluster**. Then you can either **hover over a point** and a small menu will pop up, or **right click on a data point** and a large menu will pop up.\n",

You can see the columns Profit and Quantity doing the summation at the level of granularity and the ratio SUM([Profit])/SUM([Quantity]) is taken from those numbers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's compare the amount of profit from one market to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, but what if we want to **compare the percent of profits from each market to the total profit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by doing a Table Calculation. Select the **drop down associated with SUM(Profit)**, and select **Quick Table Calculation... > Percent of Total**. Alternatively, it could be useful to look at compounding profit, which is also easily done from the same menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of table calculations work well for line plots. Let's take a look at an example. Add the Order Date to the Columns and Sales to the Rows. Make sure the **Order Date is continuous**. Drill down to the **Quarter level**, and select **Quick Table Calculation... > Percent Difference**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a better idea of how things are moving over time, we might use a **moving average**. You can see below how this is done using the table calculations. Additionally, I broke out the **Category** to see how things change over time for each.\n",

    "This plot is great for seeing the trend of the data, and that sales are increasing, but they aren't great for seeing how sales are changing over time from one quarter to the next. Instead, the last question on the next concept requires the plot below."

    "Though there is a ton you can do with Tableau, you are now ready to take on essentially building any visual in Tableau! You have come a long way in a short amount of time, and you should feel comfortable navigating the many facets of the Tableau environment!\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the topics that were covered in this section. In the next section, you will watch a professional navigate Tableau to gain a few tips, and you will see a few advanced features of Tableau like dashboards and stories\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topics Covered**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of ways you can interact with data using Tableau. This lesson is going to cover A LOT of information. Don't worry if you don't memorize where everything is stored. The goal is to gain familiarity with Tableau, so you aren't afraid to explore beyond the course materials on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the below summary might seem overwhelming. It is just here to assist as a nice template of what is to come. Don't worry if you don't follow it all right now. That is what this lesson is for!\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, here are the areas this lesson will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "**I. Connecting to Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will get started with **importing data into Tableau**. **Tableau public** has fewer options, but **paid versions of Tableau** are quite extensive connecting directly to databases and cloud based data storage systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**II. Combining Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will learn how to **connect data from multiple sources** for use in your visuals. If you are comfortable with SQL joins, this section should be second nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**III. Worksheets**\n",
    "\n",
    "The visuals you create will be stored in **worksheets**. This is the template we will be working in for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IV. Aggregations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau performs **aggregations of our data by default**. In this section, you will learn more about how to work with different aggregations, as well as how to break your aggregations into a more granular level of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**V. Hierarchies**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchies allow you to **'drill' into your data and questions at different levels**. One of the easiest ways to think of hierarchies is in relation to time. You could look at **your data at a year, month, day, hour, or another level**. Moving across these levels is considered working with hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also perform hierarchical calculations in other ways. Imagine you have a **different companies, with different departments, and teams within those departments**. This creates a hierarchy that you might want to analyze at different levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VI. Marks & Filters**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filtering** is one of the most powerful techniques in creating dashboards. This relates to the marks portion of a dashboard, which controls the **colors, shapes and other attributes of our data**. You can think of this like a **WHERE statement in SQL** used to filter your data to only the parts you are interested in for a specific question.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VII. Show Me**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Show Me portion of Tableau controls **what your ending visual looks like**. There are a lot of options here. In most cases, Tableau will guess what visual you want to create, but sometimes you might have your own ideas for implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VIII. Small Multiples & Dual Axis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Small multiples & dual charts are a way to **visualize data that needs to share an axis for comparison purposes**. [This](http://www.evolytics.com/blog/tableau-201-how-to-make-small-multiples/) and [this](http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/multiplemeasures_dualaxes.html) are great articles for explaining how these two parts of Tableau work and why you might use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IX. Groups & Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "Groups and sets are two ways to **categorize our data within a visualization**. The difference between these two can be confusing, but we will see when and why you would use each.\n",
    "\n",
    "**X. Calculated Fields**\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you might add these fields to your dataset before adding your data to Tableau, but sometimes you want to add them to a visualization on the fly. Many of these calculated fields are things you have probably done in a spreadsheets application like finding a total or a cost per item.\n",
    "\n",
    "**XI. Table Calculations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Table calculations are often used to **perform comparisons of our data over time or between groups**. A great article on table calculations is available [here](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2017/2/top-10-tableau-table-calculations-65417).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Thoughts**\n",
    "\n",
    "These shouldn't feel so daunting anymore.
