    "Gathering data is the first step in data wrangling. Before gathering, we have no data, and after it, we do.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do find your data, it's not unusual for it to be spread across several different sources and file formats, which makes things tricky when organizing the data in your programming environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will be structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we'll pose a few questions.\n",
    "2. Then you'll explore the source of each piece of data we need to answer those questions, each piece from a different source and in a different format.\n",
    "3. Then you'll learn about the structure of each file format.\n",
    "4. Then you'll learn how to handle that file format using Python and its libraries.\n",
    "5. Then you'll actually gather each piece of data to later join together to create your master dataset."

But in reality, image files aren't special—they're just binary files. To interact with them, you don't need special software (like Photoshop or something) that \"understands\" images. You can use regular file opening, reading, and writing techniques, like this:\n",

    "This type of error is why the requests library maintainers recommend using the PIL library (short for Pillow) and BytesIO from the io library for non-text requests, like images.

    "    * Uses try and except blocks to attempt to query MediaWiki for a movie poster image URL and to attempt to download that image. If the attempt fails and an error is encountered, the offending movie is documented in image_errors.\n",
