    "Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users."

    "Before looking at the bike sharing data, you should start by asking questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? If you were a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how you would want to use the service?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: Write at least two questions related to bike sharing that you think could be answered by data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: where are locations people mostly use? what is the reason people walking rather than using bycycling-share?\n",

    "Now it's time to collect and explore our data. In this project, we will focus on the record of individual trips taken in 2016 from our selected cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Each of these cities has a page where we can freely download the trip data.:\n",

    "- New York City (Citi Bike): [Link](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)\n",
    "- Chicago (Divvy): [Link](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)\n",
    "- Washington, DC (Capital Bikeshare): [Link](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you visit these pages, you will notice that each city has a different way of delivering its data. Chicago updates with new data twice a year, Washington DC is quarterly, and New York City is monthly. **However, you do not need to download the data yourself.** The data has already been collected for you in the `/data/` folder of the project files. While the original data for 2016 is spread among multiple files for each city, the files in the `/data/` folder collect all of the trip data for the year into one file per city. Some data wrangling of inconsistencies in timestamp format within each city has already been performed for you. In addition, a random 2% sample of the original data is taken to make the exploration more manageable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: However, there is still a lot of data for us to investigate, so it's a good idea to start off by looking at one entry from each of the cities we're going to analyze. Run the first code cell below to load some packages and functions that you'll be using in your analysis. Then, complete the second code cell to print out the first trip recorded from each of the cities (the second line of each data file).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: You can run a code cell like you formatted Markdown cells above by clicking on the cell and using the keyboard shortcut **Shift** + **Enter** or **Shift** + **Return**. Alternatively, a code cell can be executed using the **Play** button in the toolbar after selecting it. While the cell is running, you will see an asterisk in the message to the left of the cell, i.e. `In [*]:`. The asterisk will change into a number to show that execution has completed, e.g. `In [1]`. If there is output, it will show up as `Out [1]:`, with an appropriate number to match the \"In\" number."

Use the start time of the trip to obtain these values. The New York City data includes the seconds in their timestamps, while Washington and Chicago do not. The [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) package will be very useful here to make the needed conversions.\n",
    "- **User Type**: It is possible that users who are subscribed to a bike-share system will have different patterns of use compared to users who only have temporary passes. Washington divides its users into two types: 'Registered' for users with annual, monthly, and other longer-term subscriptions, and 'Casual', for users with 24-hour, 3-day, and other short-term passes. The New York and Chicago data uses 'Subscriber' and 'Customer' for these groups, respectively. For consistency, you will convert the Washington labels to match the other two.\n",

On the other hand, the peak time for customers are during weekends, which implies that customers might use the system as a kind of leisure activities.\n",

    "Congratulations on completing the project! This is only a sampling of the data analysis process: from generating questions, wrangling the data, and to exploring the data. Normally, at this point in the data analysis process, you might want to draw conclusions about the data by performing a statistical test or fitting the data to a model for making predictions. There are also a lot of potential analyses that could be performed on the data which are not possible with only the data provided. For example, detailed location data has not been investigated. Where are the most commonly used docks? What are the most common routes? As another example, weather has potential to have a large impact on daily ridership. How much is ridership impacted when there is rain or snow? Are subscribers or customers affected more by changes in weather?\n",

    "**Answer**: The local businesses and the composition of local population. The population composition of a certain area should give us insight about the what kind of businesses are morely like to survive or earn money in that area.\n",

    "> **Tip**: If we want to share the results of our analysis with others, we aren't limited to giving them a copy of the jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. We can also export the Notebook output in a form that can be opened even for those without Python installed. From the **File** menu in the upper left, go to the **Download as** submenu. You can then choose a different format that can be viewed more generally, such as HTML (.html) or\n",

    "> If you are working on this project via the Project Notebook page in the classroom, you can also submit this project directly from the workspace. **Before you do that**, you should save an HTML copy of the completed project to the workspace by running the code cell below. If it worked correctly, the output code should be a 0, and if you click on the jupyter icon in the upper left, you should see your .html document in the workspace directory. Alternatively, you can download the .html copy of your report following the steps in the previous paragraph, then _upload_ the report to the directory (by clicking the jupyter icon).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Either way, once you've gotten the .html report in your workspace, you can complete your submission by clicking on the \"Submit Project\" button to the lower-right hand side of the workspace."
