    "The truth is that in practice, you will commonly be working with data, which might follow a binomial distribution. So it is **less important** to **calculate these probabilities** (though this can be useful in some cases), and it is **more important** that you **understand what the Binomial Distribution is used for**, as it shows up in a lot of modeling techniques in machine learning, and it can sneak up in our datasets with tracking any outcome with two possible events. You will get some practice with this in the Python Probability Practice lesson.\n",

The events we have seen so far haven't influenced one another, but it turns out the real world is usually more complicated than this. The next section will introduce the idea of dependence, and you will learn even more with Bayes rule in the following section.\n",
