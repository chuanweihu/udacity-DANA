### What to Do First?
Notes: 
Understand the variables that are most central to your analysis

***

### Pseudo-Facebook User Data
Notes:

```{r Pseudo-Facebook User Data}
getwd()
list.files()
pf = read.csv("pseudo_facebook.tsv", sep = "\t")
names(pf)
```

***

### Histogram of Users' Birthdays
Notes:

```{r Histogram of Users\' Birthdays}
#install.packages('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)

summary(pf$dob_day)
qplot(x = dob_day, data = pf, binwidth = 1)

# ggplot
ggplot(aes(x = dob_day), data = pf) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

***

#### What are some things that you notice about this histogram?
Response: 
Now, you may have noticed this huge spike on January first. There's almost 8,000 users in this bin.

***

### Moira's Investigation
Notes: 
Think about a time when you posted a specific message or shared a photo on Facebook. What was it?

***

### Estimating Your Audience Size
Notes: 
Pass

***

#### Think about a time when you posted a specific message or shared a photo on Facebook. What was it?
Response: 
pass

#### How many of your friends do you think saw that post?
Response: 
pass

#### Think about what percent of your friends on Facebook see any posts or comments that you make in a month. What percent do you think that is?
Response: 
Pass

***

### Perceived Audience Size
Notes: 
Typically, they guessed that their audience was about a quarter of the size that it actually was.

***
### Faceting
Notes:

```{r Faceting}
qplot(x = dob_day, data = pf, binwidth = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 31, 1))

ggplot(aes(x = dob_day), data = pf) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:31)
```

#### Let’s take another look at our plot. What stands out to you here?
Response: 
Noticed this huge spike on January first.

***

### Be Skeptical - Outliers and Anomalies
Notes: 
Pass

***

### Moira's Outlier
Notes:

#### Which case do you think applies to Moira’s outlier?
Response: 
Bad data about a extreme case.

***

### Friend Count
Notes:
```{r}
summary(pf$friend_count)
```

#### What code would you enter to create a histogram of friend counts?

```{r Friend Count}
qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf)

ggplot(aes(x = friend_count), data = pf) +
  geom_histogram()
```

#### How is this plot similar to Moira's first plot?

qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf, binwidth = 10) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000))

ggplot(aes(x = friend_count), data = pf) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000))
```

```{r Faceting Friend Count}
# What code would you add to create a facet the histogram by gender?
# Add it to the code below.
qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf, binwidth = 25) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000),
                     breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50)) + 
  facet_wrap(~gender)

ggplot(aes(x = friend_count), data = pf) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 25) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000),
                     breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50)) +
  facet_wrap(~gender)
```

***

  facet_wrap(~gender)
```

***

### Statistics 'by' Gender
Notes:

```{r Statistics \'by\' Gender}
table(pf$gender)
by(pf$friend_count, pf$gender, summary)
```

#### Who on average has more friends: men or women?
Response:
women

#### What's the difference between the median friend count for women and men?
Response:
women's count greater than men about 22.
#### Why would the median be a better measure than the mean?
Response:
The median's resistant to change, since it marks the halfway point for all data 

***

### Analyzing One Variable
Reflection:
To understand the types of values they take on, what their distributions look like, and whether there are missing values or outliers.
