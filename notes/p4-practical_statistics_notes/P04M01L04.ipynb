    "3. Across **multiple coin flips**, we have the probability of seeing n heads as $ P(H)^n$. This is because these events are **independent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can get two **generic rules** from this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The probability of any event** must be between 0 and 1, **inclusive**.\n",
    "2. The **probability of the compliment event** is 1 minus the probability of an event. That is the **probability of all other possible events** is 1 minus the probability an event itself. Therefore, the **sum of all possible events** is equal to 1.\n",
    "3. If our events are **independent**, then the probability of the **string of possible events** is the **product** of those events. That is the **probability of one event AND the next AND the next event**, is the **product** of those events."
